            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Andric Tam.</p>
            <p>I'm a software developer with a bachelor's degree in computer science 
                from the University of South Florida and about 4 years of experience, with most of
                my work thus far focusing on system integrations and web APIs.</p>
            <p>My previous work experience was actually from the university at which I was studying, where
                I worked with the ID card center to connect the university's ID cards to other university 
                systems such as student meal plans and access control. </p>
            <p>More recently, I've begun pursuing an online master's degree at Georgia Tech and have entered 
                Revature's .NET training program in order to advance my technical skills. And now, I'm looking for an 
                opportunity where I can continue growing my technical skills while contributing to projects that
                have an impact on the world around me.</p>
