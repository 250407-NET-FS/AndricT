Create a backend (stretch front?) for an online car dealership. This dealership has warehouse
locations scattered throughout the country and cars can be shipped to and picked up from any location.

Engineers and salespeople are available at these locations to help service your car.
Customers should be able to buy cars and pick up at a location they specify.
No payment details for the purpose of project (every car is free! and imaginary!)
Database should hold receipts for all sales and services made.
